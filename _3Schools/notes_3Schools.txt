Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency

https://github.com/griesemer

Go's syntax is similar to C++

What is Go Used For?
Web development (server-side)
Developing network-based programs
Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
Cloud-native development

Why Use Go?
Go is fun and easy to learn
Go has fast run time and compilation time
Go supports concurrency
Go has memory management
Go works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

Statically typed
Fast run time
Compiled
Fast compile time
Supports concurrency through goroutines and channel
Has automatic garbage collection
Does not support classes and objects
Does not support inheritance

>> go version
go version go1.19.2 windows/amd64

Go Syntax::

Package declaration
Import packages
Functions
Statements and expressions

In Go, statements are separated by ending a line (hitting the Enter key) or by a semicolon ";".
The left curly bracket { cannot come at the start of a line.

Go supports single-line or multi-line comments
//,

It is not possible to declare a variable using ":=" without assigning a value to it.

There are some small differences between the var var :=

var
Can be used inside and outside of functions
Variable declaration and value assignment can be done separately

:=
Can only be used inside functions
Variable declaration and value assignment cannot be done separately (must be done in the same line)

Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
The variable name cannot be any Go keywords

Uber Go Style Guide
https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md

If a variable should have a fixed value that cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword.

Go is statically typed, meaning that once a variable type is defined, it can only store data of that type.
