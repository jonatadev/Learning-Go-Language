Go (Golang) is a general-purpose programming language built by Google
with a heavy focus on scalable, high-performance applications.

Goroutines are Go's way of managing multiple threads and in-flight requests.
Channels are used to communicate with goroutines.

Go applications compile to a single binary that can be easily packaged and distributed to the target operating system.
Go is only outperformed by the C, C++, and Rust languages.

Go, like many popular languages, implements memory management through a garbage collector,
so you don't need to worry about keeping track of memory allocations.

Since Go manages memory for you, there is no need to manually allocate and deallocate data.

Go also features static typing with type inference, so you'll only need to
provide data types in function signatures and structures.

Go's concurrency and speed make it especially prevalent with payment processors
and streaming services since they have such extreme volume requirements.
